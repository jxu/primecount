Import phi(y, b) calls for x = 10^12, alpha = 11?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
phi <- read_csv("phi.csv")
```

# Block size analysis

Just looking at y for now: highly skewed.

```{r}
acbrtx <- 11 * 10^4
summary(phi$y)
```

```{r}
ggplot(phi, aes(y)) +
  geom_density()
```


```{r}
summary(log2(phi$y))
```




```{r}
ggplot(phi, aes(log2(y))) +
  geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=log2(acbrtx))
```

Exponential size blocks such as from 2^(k-1) to 2^k are more evenly sized. Minimum block size need not be too small, maybe 2^16. Maximum block size is limited by tree's memory, such as 2^30.
